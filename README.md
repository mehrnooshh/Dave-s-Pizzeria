# Dave-s-Pizzeria Story
This is an fictional business data analytics project that I completed for learning purpose. The client, Dave, owns a pizzeria in his town. It is not dining, just take-out and deliveries. Dave would like to monitor his business performance in BI dashboard. 
We will just take care of back-end, and he is hiring someone else to build the front-end ordering system. 
There are three main areas of focus:
1.	Orders
2.	Stock Control
3.	Staff

# Overview
We imported 10 CSV files on a fictional business data into a MySQL database and ran multiple queries to extract descriptive statics from it. We practiced creating views, sub-querie, modeling relational databases, normalizing an ER model, and more. We then used MySQL connector in Microsoft Power BI to create a report and publish it on the web.
